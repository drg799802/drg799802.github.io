## Dana Gehring
I am a faculty mentor for the [ESIIL stars](https://esiil.org/) 2025 program.  This is my 3rd year of being a mentor for this program.  I am the Math Science and Technology department chair at [Oglala Lakota College](https://www.olc.edu/) and a Biology assistant professor. 2025 is my 20th year of teaching at tribal colleges. 
I am owned by several wirehair dachshunds with only 3 living with me and 3 living with my sister.  I enjoy going to dog shows, hunting, and sporting events with my dogs.
